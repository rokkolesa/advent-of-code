# advent-of-code

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] project.

In this repository, I'm about to provide solutions for the puzzles.

In 2022, I'm going to use the [Kotlin][kotlin] language with the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

In 2023, I'm going to use the [Go][golang] language.

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
